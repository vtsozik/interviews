Q: Rabbit sits on a stair. It can jump 1 step up with probability 0.5 or 1 step down with probability 0.5. 
What is the probability that rabbit will end up on the same step where he started jumping from after n jumps?
A: We can transform this problem into a game where we toss a fair coin if it falls head up, then we win $1 and
we loose $1 if it falls tail up. Since the coin is fair head and tail probabilities are both equal to 0.5. Since 
we can store an outcome of each coin toss into binary variable holding -1 for tail and +1 for head there can be
2^n coin tossing sequence combinations (i.e. this is our event space, e.g THTHTHTH represents one tossing  coin
sequence). To end up with 0 loss/win (starting step analogy) number of heads should be equal to number of tails.
This implies that n - must be even, indeed if it was odd then there's no way to return to starting position.
Since it doesn't matter how heads and tails are ordered in tossing sequence there can be 
C(n,n/2)=n!/(n-n/2)!/(n/2)! sequence combinations where the number of heads is equal to number of tails. So the
probability of 0 win/loss or ending up in a starting position after n coin tosses or rabbit jumps is equal to 
P(0,n)=C(n,n/2)/(2^n)=n!/(n-n/2)!/(n/2)!/(2^n)
