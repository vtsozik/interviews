Problem: if you have 2 coins, one of them is biased to tail. One coin is randomly 
selected, flipped and shows tail. What is the probability that this coin is biased.
Solution: Bayes Theorem: P(B|T) * P(T) = P(T|B) * P(B), where
P(T) = 1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1 = 3/4 - probability that randomly selected coin shows tail,
P(T|B) = 1, probability that biased coin shows tail,
P(B) = 1/2, probability that randomly selected coin is biased, hence:
Probability that coin that shows tail is biased:
P(B|T) = (P(T|B) * P(B)) / P(T) = (1 * 1/2) / (3/4) = 2/3
