 *
 * Demonstration of how to implement pre-emptive multithreading in user space.
 *
 * Peter Kelly <pmk@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
 *
 * Linux provides a set of functions for setting and retrieving the "user context",
 * which contains information about the state of a running process. This consists
 * of the value of all CPU registers, plus other information like the base and
 * size of the stack. This information is maintained by the kernel and CPU while
 * a thread is running, but if there are multiple threads in existence then in
 * order to switch between them it is necessary to save a thread's context in
 * memory, and then load a different context.
 *
 * The functions for doing this are:
 *
 * int getcontext(ucontext_t *ucp);
 *   Stores the context of the current thread in a ucontext_t structure
 *
 *   int setcontext(const ucontext_t *ucp);
 *     Loads the specified context from the structure into the CPU registers and
 *       continues execution from that point. This function does not "return" as such,
 *         it just transfers control to the other thread.
 *
 *         void makecontext(ucontext_t *ucp, void *func(), int argc, ...);
 *           Creates a new user context, based on values taken from an existing context
 *             plus modifications by the user. It is necessary to set up a stack before
 *               calling this function. The specified function and arguments are what the
 *                 CPU will start executing when you jump to this context.
 *
 *                 int swapcontext (ucontext_t *oucp, ucontext_t *ucp);
 *                   Stores the current context into oucp and loads the context stored in ucp.
 *                     This is used to switch between threads.
 *
 *                     The functions in the following code implement a very simple user space threading
 *                     library. An array of ucontext_t structures, threads, is used to store the
 *                     context for all suspended threads, i.e. all except the currently executing
 *                     one. When the process switches to a different thread using yield(), the current
 *                     thread's context is saved in the appropriate position in the array, and the
 *                     context from the next thread is loaded into the CPU registers.
 *
 *                     A new thread is created by calling the newthread() function, which takes
 *                     the initial function to execute in the thread as well as a single argument.
 *                     This sets up a new user context structure and allocates a stack for the thread,
 *                     whose size is determined by STACK_SIZE. The thread will not actually begin
 *                     execution until init() has been called.
 *
 *                     As a precautionary measure, we want to be able to catch stack overflows within
 *                     a thread. In order to do this, we actually allocate a slightly larger chunk
 *                     of memory for the stack, and divide it into three sections. The middle section
 *                     is the actual stack used by the thread, and the first and third sections are
 *                     "no go" areas which we mark using mprotect(). If a thread tries to access memory
 *                     just above or below the stack area, the process will get a SIGSEGV. The
 *                     malloc_protected() function handles this allocation, and makes sure that the
 *                     allocation occurs on page size boundaries, as required by mprotect().
 *                     Note that no free_protected() is included here, but in a real application this
 *                     would be needed, and it would need to unprotect the appropriate address ranges
 *                     and then call free() on the *original address* returned by malloc().
 *
 *                     The yield() function is used to switch between threads. This can either be
 *                     called directly by a thread (co-operative multithreading), or from the SIGALRM
 *                     handler (pre-emptive multithreading).
 *
 *                     The init() function sets up a timer which requests the kernel to deliver
 *                     SIGALRM to the process at a regular interval, as determined by SCHEDULE_MS.
 *                     When the signal handler is activated, the sigalrm() function is called (on
 *                     the currently thread's stack). It then calls yield() to switch to another
 *                     thread. Technically, the signal handler is still "active", and it will only
 *                     return once that thread is switched to again via another call to yield(), after
 *                     which it will continue execution of whatever that thread was doing before the
 *                     signal was received.
 *
 *                     This example does not provide any of the other primitives generally associated
 *                     with multi-threading environments, such as locks, semaphores, condition
 *                     variables etc. These could be implemented on top of the structure here. It also
 *                     does not handle the case where a thread's top-level function returns; in a real
 *                     implementation it would need to be removed from the list of active threads and
 *                     its stack freed.
 *
 *                     Note: When running this program with valgrind, you should use the following
 *                     command to avoid it getting confused about stack changes and reporting bogus
 *                     errors:
 *
 *                       valgrind --max-stackframe=32768 ./userthreads
 *
 *                       It may also be necessary to increase the scheduling interval (e.g. to 100+ms)
 *                       to avoid spurious(?) errors from valgrind.
