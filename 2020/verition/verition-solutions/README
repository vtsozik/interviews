README for the Interviewee

1. HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE

This directory is setup with tools to build and run the problem code against already prepared test cases.
You have 4 problems to solve:
problem1.cpp
problem2.cpp
problem3.cpp
problem4.cpp

To build and run code against tests for a specific problem, use the command:
./run.sh 1  # runs problem1.cpp
./run.sh 2  # runs problem2.cpp
./run.sh 3  # runs problem3.cpp
./run.sh 4  # runs problem4.cpp

To build and run code for all problems against their test cases, use the command:
./run_all.sh

2. C++ VERSION TO USE

Note that the makefile assumes your compiler can use the option '-std=c++14':
If you don't have this option available, you will need to upgrade your compiler
to a sufficiently modern version, or downgrade the C++ version to '-std=c++11', etc.
in the makefile. We would much prefer use of c++14.

3. TIMING THE TEST

Please time your test. We rely on an honor code system for you to report the time you took to solve
all the problems. You should complete the test in 2 hours or less.

4. REPORTING YOUR SOLUTIONS

To report your solutions, you may:
1. Email us back only the .cpp files, or
2. Create a tarball and email that back. If you do create a tarball,
   be sure to run make clean to remove the binaries you built before creating it.

The email address to send your results to is:
btownes@veritionfund.com

5. LOCATION OF TEST CASE INPUT DATASETS AND SOLUTIONS

Input files for test cases for problems are located in the datasets directory:

datasets/problem1:
input1  input2  input3  input4  input5  input6  input7  input8
datasets/problem2:
input1  input2  input3  input4  input5  input6
datasets/problem3:
input1  input2  input3  input4
datasets/problem4:
input1  input2  input3  input4  input5

Output files for solutions to the test cases are located in the solutions directory:

solutions/problem1:
output1  output2  output3  output4  output5  output6  output7  output8
solutions/problem2:
output1  output2  output3  output4  output5  output6
solutions/problem3:
output1  output2  output3  output4
solutions/problem4:
output1  output2  output3  output4  output5

For each problem input file, there is a corresponding solution output file.

CAVEAT EMPTOR:
Please note that the inputs provided for each problem are NOT guaranteed to
constitute an exhaustive set of test cases for the problem, and passing all
test cases may NOT necessarily mean your solution is correct.
